# DoThatDance

For dancers around the world, its not always possible to learn new choreo directly from a teacher in-person. Which, as many things do, leads us to the internet. Today, millions of self-taught dancers learn how to dance from videos online, and DoThatDance is the perfect assistant for that. 

Most times, unless youâ€™re combining multiple browser extensions or using a paid app, its difficult to find a video sharing service that includes all the features a dancer needs, until now. Go out there and DoThatDance.
